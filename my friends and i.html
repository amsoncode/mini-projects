            Hi! This is My Friends and I: From Strangers to Soulmates
        </h1>
        <p align="justify">Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures, it isn't just about spending time together but about growing, evolving, 
            and creating memories that last a lifetime. My friends and I have journeyed from awkward introductions to becoming each other's biggest supporters. 
            We've shared late-night laughter, spontaneous adventures, and stood by one another during our twists and turns. 
            Every moment, big or small, has strengthened our bond, turning us into a second home, where we have our safe comfy place. This is our story, one of loyalty, love, and unforgettable experiences.

            The Beginning: High School Era

            Back in 2020, in the midst of the pandemic when school was entirely online, 
            we were just a bunch of kids fresh out of middle school with absolutely no clue where our new high school was even located. 
            The pandemic had made it impossible to tour schools, so we ended up applying to random places.
            It all began in the most unexpected way, meeting through our class WhatsApp group. 
            Our first connection formed during a group project. It was actually just me, Shelly, Tri, Arul, and Tio 
            which are five clueless kids who had no idea there was even a team project until we were the last ones left to
            group up. But looking back, I'm glad we were late to knew about it. They turned out to be the best first friends in my life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            Fast forward about a year, and we finally met in person. At first, it was awkward, but that didn't last 
            long. Soon after, another group project came along, and this time, we needed 10 people. We teamed up 
            with others and long story short we become more than a teammate. From there, we spent countless hours 
            together—talking, laughing, studying (or at least trying to), and even crying. 
            We explored the city, shared lunch, and eventually joined the theater club together.
            Those early uncertain days turned into the best memories of my high school years, and the friendships we built continue to grow stronger.

            Even though we've all moved on to 10 different schools, pursuing 8 different majors across 3 different 
            cities, that hasn't stopped us from staying connected. If anything, it feels like we've grown even
            closer despite the distance. Our lives may have taken us in different directions, with new experiences, 
            friends, and challenges, but the bond we share remains as strong as ever. 
            We've learned to adapt to our busy schedules, meeting as much as we can on holidays.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            While we only manage to hang out a few times a year, those moments are filled with so much laughter, 
            reminiscing, and catching up that it feels like no time has passed at all. 
            Even when we can't meet in person, we find comfort in late-night chats—whether they're random banter 
            or deep discussions about our life—just like we did back in high school. 
            The distance hasn't driven us apart, instead it has deepened our appreciation for the 
            time we do get to spend together.
